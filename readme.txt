The patches are for the Breath of Fire II: Maeson hack. Intended for the original translation. 



Fusion Anti-Nerf:
	-Seny gives +25% AP (or +20% AP for fusions) instead of a variable mix of +10% and +15% with AP and one other stat, making her bonus the same as Shin's. This change does not apply to Jean, and there are no characters that allow you to stack the two basic bonuses.
	-Removes Ryu's unexplained ability to fuse with Seny or Shin. This addition was probably an accident since there's no mention of it in Maeson's readme and it's inconsistent with the game's story.
	
	-Putting two shamans on one character will give the full bonus for each instead of reduced bonuses. (25%x2 vs 20%x2)
	-Shaman + Character fusions that give a greater bonus than normal give the full bonus instead of a reduced bonus. (50% vs 40%)
	-Fusions added by Maeson that involve more than one shaman are generally removed.
	
	-Reverts the Transformations back to what stats they had in the vanilla game. I dislike the idea of having transformations hinder some of a character's stats (which can include the primary stats for their role). I believe it makes the system less diagetic and reduces the cool factor. Besides, it's quite difficult to keep every character alive throughout an entire dungeon, so the high stats reward you for playing well. The weird bizzaro transformations Maeson added have been removed in favor of some more logical and alternate combos that don't reverse their functions.

	Spar: 
		-Shin is reverted from +15% WIS/+25% AP to +50% AP
		
		From the original versions of these transformations, I've changed them for consistency:
			-Seso: +10% Stamina, +10% Agility, +10% Wisdom, +10% AP
			-Sana and Shin: -5% Strength, +10% Stamina
				 Seso by herself is considerably weaker than Solo and other transformations as a whole.
			
			-Adding Seny to Seso: +15% Agility -> +20% AP
			-Adding Spoo to Seso: +25% AP -> +20% Agility
			-Adding Shin to Seso: +5% Sta & +5% Agi -> +20% AP
			-Adding Seso to Solo: -5% Agi & +10% AP & +15% Wis -> +20% Wis
			-Adding Seny to Solo: Nothing -> +20% AP
		
	
	I noticed that the editor program had quite a few inaccuries and inconsistincies in its labeling, so while I've tried to work around that, there might be something off if there was an inaccuracy I missed.



Transformation Freedom:
	Apply Fusion Anti-Nerf first. If you aren't going to use that patch, then don't apply this one either.
	
	Bow:
		You can now combine Shin with Sana, Seso, or Solo to get the transformation, or Sana with Solo (normally just Shin and Seny)
	
	Spar:
		You can now add Sana to Seso to get the same bonus as adding Spoo (Mushroom Girl Form)
		You can now add Sana to Solo to get the same bonus as adding Seso (Bud Form)
		You can now combine Sana and Spoo to get the same bonus of Sana and Shin (Snapdragon Form)
		You can now combine Solo and Shin to get the same bonus as Sana and Shin (Snapdragon Form)
	
	Katt:
		You can now fuse Shin and Solo to get the same transformation as Shin and Sana
	
	Nina:
		You can now fuse Seny and Sana or Seny and Seso to get the transformation (normally just Seny and Spoo)
	
	Sten:
		You can now fuse Sana and Seny or Seny and Spoo to get the transformation (normally just Sana and Spoo)



Deis Anti-Nerf:
	Reverts Deis's starting stats back to their original values. She's a god! How can you nerf a god? What a grand and intoxicating innocence.
	

	I feel like Maeson's nerfs to her diminish her identity within the context of the series, particularly the drastic reduction to her HP and MP. One of her main traits in the first game is that she's incredibly tanky despite filling the role of a black mage. The fact that she's as powerful as she is in the original game was never a problem, imo, and like Ryu, she was balanced out by not being able to fuse.
